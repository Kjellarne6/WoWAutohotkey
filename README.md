# Shortcuts
 

   Toggle Auto Detect Queue Pop
   
   Shift + CTRL + F10
   
       Tired of having to wait in front of your computer for the queue to pop?
       This function automatically detects when the queue wait is over
       (Aka when the client is in the character select screen)
       It then logs in to your character by pressing enter before it ends
       It can even send a message to your Discord channel of choice - see below
       
       NOTE: This function assumes that you are in a server queue already
       NOTE: wow.png must be included and stored in the same folder as the script
